// Recovering the checkout's payment configuration when the cart save that was supposed to bring it
// back does not deliver one.
//
// Background: the payment configuration (which Stripe element is mounted, in which currency) is
// computed by the server from the cart, so a cart edit puts a hold on Pay until the recomputed
// configuration arrives with the save's response. If the save finishes without delivering one — a
// dropped connection, a timeout, a 500 rendering an HTML error page, a validation error — something
// has to decide what happens to that hold.
//
// Releasing it would be wrong. A failed request does not tell us whether the cart was persisted:
// the write may have committed and only its response been lost, in which case the server now holds
// the edited cart while the configuration on screen was computed for the previous one. Re-enabling
// Pay there could charge the buyer through an element mounted in the wrong currency for the cart
// the order is actually built from.
//
// So instead of guessing, ask the server again. The recovery is another cart save rather than a
// bare re-request of the configuration, and that choice is the load-bearing part: a save carries
// the cart the client currently holds, so its response is the configuration for that same cart.
// A bare re-request answers for whatever the server happens to hold at that moment, which is not
// necessarily the cart the buyer is looking at — if an edit landed in between, adopting that answer
// would lift the hold onto a configuration for a cart the buyer has already changed, the exact
// mismatch the hold exists to prevent.
//
// Saves also supersede each other, which is what keeps two recoveries from fighting. The cart PATCH
// is a synchronous Inertia visit, and Inertia's sync request stream is interruptible with one slot:
// starting a newer save interrupts the in-flight one. The interrupted save's `onSuccess` never runs
// and its `onFinish` reports `interrupted`, so it neither adopts a stale configuration nor starts a
// recovery for a hold the newer save now owns.
//
// If the recovery save also comes back empty-handed the hold stays on: Pay remains disabled and the
// buyer is told to reload, the only direction that cannot charge through a mismatched element.

// The name of the prop carrying the payment configuration. A response counts as having delivered
// one only if this key is actually present in it.
